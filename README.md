# ‚öΩ LaLiga Player and Team Performance Analysis

A comprehensive data analytics project utilizing Excel, SQL, and Power BI to analyze player performance, team efficiency, and disciplinary trends across the LaLiga football league.

---

## üéØ Project Goals and Key Questions

This analysis addressed five core questions to provide a 360-degree view of the league data:

1.  **Top Performers:** Who are the top-performing players overall based on rating, goals, assists, and Man of the Match awards?
2.  **Team Efficiency:** Which teams have the highest average player performance, considering ratings and goals per game?
3.  **Playing Time Impact:** How does playing time (minutes played) relate to player performance or productivity (goals and ratings)?
4.  **Positional Contribution:** Which player positions contribute the most to team success through goals, assists, and overall ratings?
5.  **Disciplinary Issues:** Which teams or positions have the most disciplinary issues, based on yellow and red card totals?

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Tool: Purpose

**Microsoft Excel**: Initial data cleaning, standardization,  handling of missing values, decoding mojibake, and editing formats
**SQL**: Complex querying, aggregation (SUM, AVG), and ranking (using `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY`).
**Power BI**: Data modeling, creating calculated columns/measures (DAX), and interactive dashboard design.

## üìä Key Findings and Visualizations

Below are the summarized answers to the core questions, demonstrating the final output of the project.

### Finding 1: Top Players & Team Efficiency
* **Top Player:** The analysis identified **Robert Lewandowski, Enes Unal, Iago Aspas, Karim Benzema, and Antoine Griezmann** as the overall best players, excelling in both G/A and MOTM awards.
* **Top Team:** **Barcelona, Athletico, and Getafe** exhibited the highest average player rating combined with the best Total_Contribution, highlighting superior squad efficiency.

### Finding 2: Playing Time vs. Contribution
* The relationship between **Minutes Played** and **Overall Rating** showed **no correlation at all, so the amount of minutes played does not affect your overall rating**. 

### Finding 3: Positional and Disciplinary Analysis
* **Discipline:** As identified by the SQL query, **Mallorca, Sevilla, Getafe** leads the league in total disciplinary cards ( over 80), confirming them as the most penalized team.
